I don't actually recommend contributing to this particular repository. I don't know where I was going with this. I mean, I do - I just find it rather frivolous.
Should you be of a different opinion, make sure to shout at me via a pull request if you have a specific feature ready or via discussions. It's bound to give me a morale boost.
